# Escape Game

We created a escape room inspired Game with 3 seperated rooms to introduce children and young adults to smart thechnolegies.
We seperated the function and the logic of every device and builded every riddle in node-red.

* rfid-reader-flow.json is the final device of the game. It requiered 9 RFID-Cards.
* morse-code-flow.json -> requires https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-interval-length
